Hi!

Welcome to the Apples To Apples Online Dev Project!

We will be building this project in three phases:

Phase 1 (early bug-catching):
    One Client and server run in same process

Phase 2 (client-server comms):
    The Client and Server are split into separate programs, and can run on different computers across the internet

Phase 3 (social networking):
    add the ability to invite friends to games, and possibly to talk in real time without skype


There may be a corollary project that sprouts up for building an AI,
but this will involve data tracking on an incredibly large scale.

If you stumbled across this repository by accident somehow, but are interested in participating,
send me an email at martinwickham@comcast.net
